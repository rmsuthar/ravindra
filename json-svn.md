# JSON SVN — The Version Control System for JSON Configurations

It's 2025. Is your growing infrastructure still forcing mobile apps and microservices to download massive, static JSON configurations on every startup? That's configuration chaos, and it's costing you time and money.

Your architecture deserves better.

## Introducing JSON SVN
The Version Control System built from the ground up for the API era. We transform configuration management from a burden into a powerful asset.

🔥 Why JSON SVN Solves Your Configuration Chaos

- ✅ Smart Deltas (The Bandwidth Killer): Clients request updates using a simple `?since={timestamp}`. We return only the difference (the delta). Reduce bandwidth costs and latency by 90%+ while dramatically improving mobile app startup times.

- ✅ Multi-Environment Synchronization: Stop managing config files in silos. Seamlessly promote configurations from DEV → UAT → PROD with a single click. No more dangerous copy-paste errors across critical environments.

- ✅ Git-Powered Versioning & Audit: Get full, Git-like version control, commit history, and complete audit logs for every change. Know who changed what and when.

- ✅ AI-Powered Workflow: Leverage Generative AI to suggest optimal JSON structures and write clear, informative commit messages, keeping your history clean and searchable.

- ✅ Enterprise Ready: Built for scale with features like SSO Integration (SAML/OIDC) and flexible On-Premise deployment options.

Whether you're managing complex feature flags, granular mobile remote configuration, or CMS data, it's time to stop treating JSON like static text. Treat it like code.
